# Codecademy-Project-Solutions


In this repository you will find my solution to the Codecademy Projects. I will update the solutions as I go along, but the main focus of this repository will be for C++, Python, and Front End Projects. So far I have included the following languages:
    -HTML
    -JavaScript
    -Ruby
    -Python
    -C++

It will focus more heavily on C++ / Java for the time being and may delve into React in the future.
